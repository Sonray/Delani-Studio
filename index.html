        <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary 
            time needed to understand your product vision <br>
            The outcome of this scoping vision is a proposal or high-levelstatement of work.<br>
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces 
            you need.
